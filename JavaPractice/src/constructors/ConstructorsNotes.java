			In Java, constructors are special methods used to initialize objects. 
			They are called when an instance of a class is created. Unlike regular methods, constructors
			do not have a return type, not even void, and their name must match the class name exactly.

			Types of Constructors in Java:
										Default Constructor
										Parameterized Constructor
										No-Argument Constructor
										Copy Constructor
