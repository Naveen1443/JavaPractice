User-defined methods in Java are methods that are created by the programmer to perform specific tasks. 
These methods help in organizing code, improving readability, and promoting re-useability.
 A method typically consists of a method signature (which includes the method name, return type, and parameters) and 
 a method body (which contains the code to be executed when the method is called).

Types of User-defined Methods

Void Methods:              These methods do not return any value.
Value-returning Methods:   These methods return a value of a specific type.
Parameterized Methods:     These methods accept parameters.
Non-parameterized Methods: These methods do not accept parameters.
