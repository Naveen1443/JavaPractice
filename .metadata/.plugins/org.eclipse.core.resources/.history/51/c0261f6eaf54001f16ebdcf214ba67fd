User-defined methods in Java are methods that are created by the programmer to perform specific tasks. 
These methods help in organizing code, improving readability, and promoting re-useability.
 A method typically consists of a method signature (which includes the method name, return type, and parameters) and 
 a method body (which contains the code to be executed when the method is called).

Types of User-defined Methods

Void Methods:              These methods do not return any value.
Value-returning Methods:   These methods return a value of a specific type.
Parameterized Methods:     These methods accept parameters.
Non-parameterized Methods: These methods do not accept parameters.

Explanation
						 	
Value-returning Methods: 	These methods perform an action and return a value. 
						 	The calculateSquare method returns the square of a number.
						 	
Parameterized Methods:   	These methods take input parameters, perform an action, and optionally return a value.
						 	The checkEven method checks if a number is even and returns a boolean.
						 	
Non-parameterized Methods:  These methods do not take any input parameters.
							The printCurrentTime method prints the current time without needing any input.
 							By using user-defined methods, programmers can modularize their code,
							making it more maintainable and understandable.
