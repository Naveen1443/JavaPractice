/*
 * n Java, predefined methods are the method that is already defined in the
 *  Java class libraries is known as predefined methods. It is also known as 
 *  the standard library method or built-in method. We can directly use these 
 *  methods just by calling them in the program at any point. Some pre-defined 
 *  methods are length(), equals(), compareTo(), sqrt(), etc. When we call any of 
 *  the predefined methods in our program, a series of codes related to the
