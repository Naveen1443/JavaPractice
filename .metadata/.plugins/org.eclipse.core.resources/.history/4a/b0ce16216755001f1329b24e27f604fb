/*
Decision-Making Statements in Java: switch Statement
							The switch statement in Java is another decision-making statement used 
							when you have multiple possible outcomes for a single variable. Itâ€™s an 
							alternative to using multiple if-else statements and can make your code more 
							readable and easier to maintain when dealing with multiple conditions based on 
							a single expression.

switch Statement
Definition:The switch statement evaluates the value of an expression (usually a variable) and compares it 
		   against multiple cases. If a match is found, the code block associated with that case is executed.
		   If no match is found, the default case (if provided) is executed.
